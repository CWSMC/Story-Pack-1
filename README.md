Days after a nuclear bomb explodes over North America the entire world has entered a sub-zero winter. With one of the world's biggest economic engines now largely a crater the stock markets crash and money is more useful as fuel than currency. people hole up in abandoned buildings, and humans kill over what little food remains on the planet. City streets become fierce war zones, and families turn on one another in deadly fighting to the last man standing, but what remains of the US Government has far bigger concerns. The old presidential system is gone, replaced by a council and they have received word that a remote clan is preparing to release a biological weapon. The rumor is that the weapon is ready and the clan is only waiting on creating a cure for themselves to deploy it. The plan is to send an elite group of soldiers in to destroy the cure and weapon and prevent the clan from launching them, the mission will be dangerous, the journey long and hard and the consequence of failure is global death. Throughout the journey, the soldiers will learn what an incredible blessing friendship can be, and the high price this new world places on it.

## Revelation 17:8-10
> The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come. This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while.

## Introduction
Cold didn't even describe the feeling that invaded every crevice of your being. You are headed to the coldest place on earth; a place called Oymyakon in the arctic circle. It is there that the United Sates government has set up their newest, and most advanced military outpost. "Lanky over here has cold feet!" Private James "Bear" Willis yells over the spinning rotors to Captain John J. Madison. John smirked as he prepared to fly over the last stretch of forest as they approached the drop zone. You make some half-remembered witty comment to the crew and they laugh. In less than 10 minutes they will all be dead. You dose off and are awakened by an alarm. "BRACE!" yells Captain John right before the world explodes around you.

The first thing that hits you is the pain, burning, suffocating headache inducing fumes. You try to call out but when you inhale your lungs sear and you cough soot onto the ash strewn ground. You begin crawling out and away. You have no concept of direction, but you know you need to get out now. Just as you leave the wreckage pile you hear a brief roar and then feel a freight train hit you from behind, blasting you forward and driving you into the sandy shore. Then... darkness.
